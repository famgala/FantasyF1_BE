## Codebase Patterns

### Admin Panel Pattern
- Admin pages should check `user?.is_superuser` and redirect non-superusers immediately with toast error
- Use consistent stat card design with color-coded backgrounds (blue, green, purple, orange, red, cyan)
- Auto-refresh data every 5 minutes for statistics, 30 seconds for health status
- Admin navigation cards link to other admin tools with clear descriptions
- Charts use SVG bar charts with consistent styling (viewBox, rx for rounded corners)

### Component Architecture
- Page components export both named export (for imports) and default export (for lazy loading)
- Use `useCallback` for fetch functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Implement loading states with `loading` and `isRefreshing` flags for better UX
- Error states should include retry functionality
- Auto-refresh intervals should be cleaned up in useEffect return function

### User Management Pattern
- User tables should display: username, email, full_name, is_active, is_superuser, created_at
- Status badges use color coding: green for active, red for inactive, yellow for superuser
- Search should filter across username, email, and full_name fields
- Filters for active/inactive status and superuser status
- User detail modal shows profile info, stats (team count, league count), and activity history
- Cannot modify own account (protect against self-deactivation)
- Confirmation dialogs required for all sensitive operations (activate/deactivate, grant/revoke superuser)
- Toast notifications for all success/error feedback

### Landing Page Pattern
- Landing pages for non-authenticated users should be at root URL (/)
- Hero section with strong value proposition and clear CTA buttons
- Features section highlighting key product benefits with icons
- How It Works section with step-by-step numbered guide
- Statistics section showing platform growth (fetched from API)
- Email capture form that checks if email exists before redirecting
- Update Login and Register pages to handle email state from LandingPage redirects
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Footer with navigation links (disabled state for coming soon)

### Password Reset Pattern
- Forgot password page should use security-aware messaging (don't reveal if email exists)
- Reset password page extracts token from URL query params
- Password validation should match registration requirements (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, digit)
- Confirm password field with matching validation
- Auto-redirect to login page after successful reset with countdown timer
- Handle expired/invalid tokens gracefully with user-friendly error messages
- Add routes as public routes (accessible without authentication)
- Link from Login page to Forgot Password page
- Use error boundary pattern: catch block without parameter name to avoid lint errors

### Race Results Pattern
- Race results endpoint returns 403 for non-completed races (upcoming/ongoing)
- Display finishing positions 1-20 with position badges (gold/silver/bronze for podium)
- Show grid position vs final position with visual indicators (green arrow up for gained, red arrow down for lost)
- DNF status with distinct styling (red badge, strikethrough text)
- Fastest lap indicator (purple lightning bolt icon)
- Winning constructor displayed in header section
- Link from RaceDetail page to RaceResults page
- Backend service layer needed to transform raw race data into formatted results

### Driver Performance Pattern
- Performance tab on driver detail page for race-by-race analysis
- SVG bar chart for points per race visualization
- Season statistics summary (total points, avg points, best/worst finish, podiums, DNFs)
- Race results table with columns: Round, Race, Date, Grid, Position, Points, Fastest Lap, Status
- Position styling: gold/silver/bronze for podium, red strikethrough for DNF
- Color-coded bars in chart (blue for points, red for DNF, gray for zero points)
- Tab navigation between Overview and Performance views
- Backend joins RaceResult with Race to get race details for each performance record

### Activity Feed Auto-Refresh Pattern
- Activity feeds should auto-refresh periodically (default 60 seconds) to show real-time updates
- Use `setInterval` in useEffect with cleanup function to prevent memory leaks
- Display "Last updated X ago" timestamp to show when data was last fetched
- Make auto-refresh configurable via props (refreshInterval, autoRefresh)
- Auto-refresh should be disabled when component unmounts or when autoRefresh prop is false
- Use `useCallback` for fetch functions to include in dependency arrays

## 2/2/2026, 7:26 AM - US-046: Driver Performance History (Implementation Completed)
- **Completed implementation of backend and frontend for Driver Performance:**
  - Created backend endpoint `GET /api/v1/drivers/{driver_id}/performance`:
    - Returns DriverPerformanceResponse with driver info, statistics, and race results
    - Joins RaceResult with Race to get race details
    - Calculates statistics: total points, avg points, best/worst finish, podiums, DNFs
  - Created Pydantic schemas in driver.py:
    - DriverRaceResult: Individual race performance data
    - DriverPerformanceStats: Aggregated statistics
    - DriverPerformanceResponse: Combined response structure
  - Implemented get_driver_performance service method in driver_service.py:
    - Fetches all race results for driver joined with race data
    - Builds race results list with position, grid, points, DNF status
    - Calculates comprehensive statistics from race data
    - Raises NotFoundError if driver doesn't exist
  - Frontend already had full implementation:
    - Performance tab on DriverDetail.tsx with all features
    - Race-by-race performance table with all required columns
    - SVG bar chart showing points per race
    - Season statistics summary card

- **Files changed:**
  - `FantasyF1_BE/app/api/v1/endpoints/drivers.py` - Added GET /{id}/performance endpoint
  - `FantasyF1_BE/app/services/driver_service.py` - Added get_driver_performance method
  - `FantasyF1_BE/app/schemas/driver.py` - Added performance-related Pydantic schemas
  - `frontend/src/pages/DriverDetail.tsx` - Already had performance tab (verified)
  - `frontend/src/services/driverService.ts` - Already had getDriverPerformance (verified)
  - `frontend/src/types/index.ts` - Already had Driver performance types (verified)

- **Quality checks:**
  - ✅ TypeScript check passed (npx tsc --noEmit)
  - ✅ Black formatting passed
  - ✅ Ruff linting passed (all checks passed)
  - ✅ Commit successful: `feat: US-046 - Driver Performance History`
  - ✅ Updated prd.json to mark US-046 as passing

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - When joining tables in SQLAlchemy, use `select(ModelA, ModelB).join(...)` pattern
  - Calculate statistics by iterating over fetched results rather than multiple queries
  - SVG charts are lightweight alternative to heavy charting libraries
  - Position-based styling (gold/silver/bronze) provides immediate visual hierarchy
  - DNF status should be prominent with distinct red styling
  - NotFoundError expects dict for details parameter: `{"driver_id": driver_id}`

  - Display "Last updated X ago" timestamp in header when auto-refresh is enabled
  - Auto-refresh is disabled when component unmounts or when autoRefresh prop is false
  - Used `useCallback` for fetchActivities function to include in dependency arrays

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Activity feeds should auto-refresh periodically (default 60 seconds) to show real-time updates
  - Use `setInterval` in useEffect with cleanup function to prevent memory leaks
  - Display "Last updated X ago" timestamp to show when data was last fetched
  - Make auto-refresh configurable via props (refreshInterval, autoRefresh)
  - Auto-refresh should be disabled when component unmounts or when autoRefresh prop is false
  - Use `useCallback` for fetch functions to include in dependency arrays
  - Note: Backend endpoint is `/activities` (plural) not `/activity` as mentioned in acceptance criteria
