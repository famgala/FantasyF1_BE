## Codebase Patterns
- Use Vite + React + TypeScript for frontend development
- Use React Router for routing with ProtectedRoute component for auth
- Use Context API for global state management (AuthContext)
- Use axios for API calls with interceptors for token refresh
- Store JWT tokens in localStorage (access_token, refresh_token)
- Use type-only imports for types when verbatimModuleSyntax is enabled
- All TypeScript types defined in src/types/index.ts
- Services in src/services/ for API interactions
- Pages in src/pages/ for route components
- Components in src/components/ for reusable UI elements
- Environment variables use VITE_ prefix and are accessed via import.meta.env

## 1/31/2026 - US-001
- Implemented complete user authentication system with React + TypeScript + Vite
- Created project structure with components, pages, services, hooks, and types directories
- Implemented Login page with form validation, remember me functionality, and error handling
- Implemented Register page with password strength validation (8 chars, 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 digit)
- Created AuthContext for global authentication state management
- Implemented ProtectedRoute component for route protection
- Created API client (api.ts) with axios interceptors for automatic token refresh
- Implemented authService for auth operations (login, register, logout, getCurrentUser)
- Created Dashboard page for authenticated users
- Configured React Router with public and protected routes
- Added TypeScript types for all entities (User, AuthResponse, League, Team, Driver, Race, Notification, Invitation, Draft, etc.)
- Set up environment configuration with .env file
- Fixed TypeScript errors related to type imports and unused variables
- All TypeScript checks pass successfully (npm run build)
- Files created/modified:
  - frontend/src/App.tsx - Main app with routing
  - frontend/src/main.tsx - Entry point
  - frontend/src/context/AuthContext.tsx - Auth state management
  - frontend/src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx - Route protection
  - frontend/src/pages/Login.tsx - Login page
  - frontend/src/pages/Register.tsx - Registration page
  - frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx - Dashboard page
  - frontend/src/services/api.ts - API client with interceptors
  - frontend/src/services/authService.ts - Auth service
  - frontend/src/types/index.ts - TypeScript type definitions
  - frontend/.env - Environment configuration
  - frontend/package.json - Dependencies and scripts
  - frontend/tsconfig.json - TypeScript configuration
  - frontend/vite.config.ts - Vite configuration
  - frontend/eslint.config.js - ESLint configuration
  - frontend/index.html - HTML entry point
  - frontend/src/index.css - Global styles
  - frontend/src/App.css - App-specific styles

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- When using TypeScript with verbatimModuleSyntax enabled, must use type-only imports for types: `import type { TypeName } from 'module'`
- Remove unused imports to avoid TS6133 errors
- The AuthResponse type needs optional refresh_token field for token refresh functionality
- API client interceptors handle token refresh automatically on 401 errors
- AuthContext checks authentication on mount and stores user in localStorage
- ProtectedRoute redirects to login if not authenticated
- Login/Register pages redirect to dashboard if already authenticated
- Use localStorage for token storage (access_token, refresh_token, user)
- Environment variables must use VITE_ prefix in Vite projects
- Build command `npm run build` runs both TypeScript compiler and Vite build
- All acceptance criteria for US-001 have been met
- Manual browser verification is recommended to test the full auth flow

## 1/31/2026 - US-002
- Implemented complete user profile management system with React + TypeScript
- Created userService for user profile API operations (getCurrentUser, updateProfile, changePassword)
- Created Profile page displaying user information with account status and type indicators
- Created EditProfileForm component with two sections: Profile Information and Change Password
- Implemented comprehensive form validation for email, full name, and password fields
- Password validation includes: minimum 8 characters, 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 digit
- Email validation with regex pattern checking
- Full name validation with length constraints (3-100 characters)
- Password change requires current password confirmation
- Real-time validation on input change and blur events
- Success/error messages displayed as alerts
- Profile changes reflected immediately in UI via AuthContext setUser
- Added comprehensive CSS styling for profile pages and forms in App.css
- Profile page shows: username, email, full name, account status, account type, member since date
- Edit form allows updating email and full name (username is read-only)
- Password change form with current password, new password, and confirm password fields
- All TypeScript checks pass successfully (npm run build)
- Files created/modified:
  - frontend/src/services/userService.ts - User profile API service
  - frontend/src/pages/Profile.tsx - Profile page component
  - frontend/src/components/EditProfileForm.tsx - Edit profile form component
  - frontend/src/App.css - Added comprehensive styling for profile pages and forms
  - frontend/src/App.tsx - Already had Profile route configured
  - frontend/src/context/AuthContext.tsx - Already had setUser for state updates

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Use separate form sections for different types of updates (profile info vs password change)
- Real-time validation on both change and blur events provides better UX
- Password strength validation should match backend requirements exactly
- Display account status and type with visual indicators (color-coded badges)
- Form validation errors should be shown inline below each field
- Success messages should trigger automatic navigation after a short delay
- Use disabled state for read-only fields (username) with visual indication
- Clear password fields after successful password change
- Profile page should refresh data after successful updates
- CSS classes follow Bootstrap-like naming convention (form-control, form-group, btn-primary, etc.)
- Alert components need both error and success variants with different colors
- All acceptance criteria for US-002 have been met
- Manual browser verification is recommended to test profile viewing and editing

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Use debounce pattern for search inputs to reduce API calls (300ms is a good default)
- Reset pagination to page 1 when search query or filters change
- The apiClient methods already return data directly, don't access .data property again
- Use named imports from api.ts: `import { apiClient as api } from './api'`
- League cards should display key information at a glance: name, privacy, team count, draft method
- Privacy badges use color coding for visual distinction (green=public, red=private)
- Grid layout with `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr))` provides responsive card layout
- Hover effects on cards (translateY and box-shadow) improve UX
- Empty states should provide context and actionable options (clear search button)
- Loading states with spinner animation provide visual feedback during API calls
- Pagination should show page numbers for quick navigation
- Results info helps users understand the scope of data
