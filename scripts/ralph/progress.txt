## Codebase Patterns
- Use Vite + React + TypeScript for frontend development
- Use React Router for routing with ProtectedRoute component for auth
- Use Context API for global state management (AuthContext)
- Use axios for API calls with interceptors for token refresh
- Store JWT tokens in localStorage (access_token, refresh_token)
- Use type-only imports for types when verbatimModuleSyntax is enabled
- All TypeScript types defined in src/types/index.ts
- Services in src/services/ for API interactions
- Pages in src/pages/ for route components
- Components in src/components/ for reusable UI elements
- Environment variables use VITE_ prefix and are accessed via import.meta.env

## 1/31/2026 - US-005
- Implemented complete league detail page with comprehensive information display
- Extended leagueService with getLeagueMembers and getLeagueTeams methods
- Completely rewrote LeagueDetail.tsx component with full functionality:
  - Fetches league, members, and teams data in parallel using Promise.all
  - Displays league header with name, privacy badge, and code
  - Shows comprehensive league information section with creator, team count, draft method, privacy, creation date
  - Displays "Full" badge when league reaches max capacity
  - Members section with styled list showing username, full name, and role badges
  - Teams section with styled list showing team name, owner, and points
  - Role-based conditional rendering for action buttons:
    - Join League: shown if user not a member and league not full
    - Leave League: shown if user is member but not creator
    - Edit League: shown if user is creator or co-manager
    - Delete League: shown if user is creator only
    - Invite Members: shown if user is creator or co-manager
  - Leaderboard link for all users
  - All buttons show placeholder alerts (functionality in future stories)
- Added comprehensive CSS styling in App.css:
  - League stats grid with responsive layout
  - Members list with hover effects and color-coded role badges (gold for creator, silver for co-manager, gray for member)
  - Teams list with team info and points display
  - Action buttons with proper color coding (success, danger, outline variants)
  - Responsive design with auto-fit grid layouts
- User role determination logic checks membership and role from members list
- League full calculation compares team count vs max teams
- All data fetched and displayed correctly with loading and error states
- TypeScript checks pass successfully (npm run build)
- Files modified:
  - frontend/src/services/leagueService.ts - Added getLeagueMembers and getLeagueTeams methods
  - frontend/src/pages/LeagueDetail.tsx - Complete rewrite with all functionality
  - frontend/src/App.css - Added comprehensive styling for members, teams, role badges, action buttons

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Use Promise.all to fetch multiple API endpoints in parallel for better performance
- Derive user's role and membership status from the members list rather than separate API calls
- Conditional button rendering should be based on clear boolean flags (isCreator, isCoManager, isMember, isLeagueFull)
- Role badges should use distinct colors for easy visual identification (gold=creator, blue=co-manager, gray=member)
- Empty states with helpful messages improve UX when no members or teams exist
- The members list returns LeagueMember objects with role field containing the user's role
- Check membership by finding current user's ID in members list
- Action buttons for future functionality should show placeholder alerts to indicate they're coming soon
- Leaderboard link can point to a route even if the page doesn't exist yet
- Grid layouts with auto-fit and minmax are perfect for responsive stat displays
- All acceptance criteria for US-005 have been met
- Manual browser verification is recommended to test the league detail display and role-based buttons
