## Codebase Patterns
- Frontend uses React + TypeScript with Vite
- API service pattern: Create service files in `services/` directory using `apiClient` from `api.ts`
- Type definitions go in `types/index.ts` with interfaces for all API requests/responses
- Page components go in `pages/` directory, imported and routed in `App.tsx`
- Navigation buttons added to `Dashboard.tsx` for main features
- CSS styling consolidated in `App.css` with section comments for each feature
- Use Tailwind CSS classes for layout, custom CSS for specific component styling
- Form validation handled inline with error state and error messages
- Modal pattern: overlay + container with header/content/actions sections
- Empty states should have call-to-action buttons when applicable
- Loading states use spinner component, disable buttons during submission
- Notification badges use absolute positioning with red background
- League invitations endpoint uses GET /api/v1/leagues/{league_id}/invitations (not /invitations/{league_id}/all)
- Status badges use colored backgrounds: yellow (pending), green (accepted), red (rejected), gray (expired)
- Responsive card layouts: stack on mobile, table-like grid on desktop using CSS grid
- Inviter info shows username when available, otherwise fallback to user_id

## 2/1/2026, 5:45 AM UTC - US-014
- **Story**: View League Invitations (Manager View) - View all invitations for a league
- **What was implemented**:
  - Created `LeagueInvitations.tsx` page component at `/leagues/:id/invitations`
  - Extended `invitationService.ts` with `getLeagueInvitations(leagueId)` method
  - Page displays all invitations sent for the league by any manager/co-manager
  - Each invitation shows: invitee info (email/username/user_id), inviter username, status badge, sent date
  - Status filter dropdown (All, Pending, Accepted, Rejected, Expired)
  - Info box showing which co-managers can send invitations
  - Mobile-responsive layout: cards on mobile, table-like header on desktop
  - Loading states, error handling, and empty state
  - Added "Manage Invitations" button in `LeagueDetail.tsx` (visible to creators/co-managers)
  - Added route in `App.tsx` for the new page
  - Comprehensive CSS styling for page, cards, status badges, filters
- **Files changed**:
  - `frontend/src/pages/LeagueInvitations.tsx` - New page component
  - `frontend/src/services/invitationService.ts` - Added getLeagueInvitations method
  - `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Added route /leagues/:id/invitations
  - `frontend/src/pages/LeagueDetail.tsx` - Added Manage Invitations button for creators/co-managers
  - `frontend/src/App.css` - Added comprehensive styling for league invitations page
- **Learnings for future iterations**:
  - League invitations endpoint is GET /api/v1/leagues/{league_id}/invitations (different from PRD spec)
  - The API response includes all invitations for the league regardless of who sent them
  - Shows inviter info including username and user_id to track which manager sent each invitation
  - Status badges use consistent color scheme across invitation pages
  - Responsive design: mobile shows stacked cards with labels, desktop shows grid layout with headers
  - Invitee info shows email if available, otherwise username or user_id
  - Empty state provides context about who can send invitations
  - Uses same invitation types as other invitation pages for consistency
- **Typecheck**: Passed with no errors
- **Commit**: `feat: US-014 - View Sent Invitations from League Page`

  - Dashboard badge fetches invitations on mount and filters for pending status
  - Modals use a consistent pattern: overlay, container, header, body, actions
  - Accept action requires team name (league join requirement)
  - Reject action has optional reason field
  - After accept/reject, the list refreshes automatically
  - TypeScript "unused import" errors are caught by `npm run build` (tsc -b)
