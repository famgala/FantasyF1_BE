# CodeDocuments

This directory contains code-related documentation and guides for the FantasyF1 backend project.

## Purpose

The `CodeDocuments` folder stores documentation that specifically relates to code quality, development workflows, and implementation standards. This is separate from the main `documentation/` folder which focuses on architecture, design decisions, and project planning.

## Contents

- **PRE_COMMIT_HOOK.md** - Documentation for the Git pre-commit hook that enforces CI checks before commits

## Convention

When adding documentation to this directory, consider:

1. **If it's about the project structure/architecture features** → Use the root `documentation/` folder
2. **If it's about development workflows, coding standards, or tooling** → Use this `CodeDocuments/` folder
